# OSK Toggle

A [Noctalia](https://github.com/noctalia-dev/noctalia) bar widget for toggling an on-screen keyboard. Supports **Squeekboard** and **wvkbd**, with automatic backend detection.

## Features

- Auto-detects which OSK is available at startup, or use a fixed backend
- Live availability detection — shows an alert icon if the keyboard is no longer available
- Hover icons indicate the action you'll take (show/hide), not just the current state
- Configurable per-widget settings

## Requirements

- Noctalia ≥ 4.4.3
- One of:
  - **Squeekboard** — must be running and accessible via D-Bus (`sm.puri.OSK0`); requires `gsettings` and `dconf`
  - **wvkbd** — any binary variant (`wvkbd-mobintl`, `wvkbd-comp`, `wvkbd-abc`, etc.) on your `PATH`

## Settings

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `backend` | `auto` | `auto`, `squeekboard`, or `wvkbd` |
| `hideWhenUnavailable` | `false` | Hide the widget entirely when the OSK is unavailable |
| `disableHoverIcon` | `false` | Always show the state icon; never show the directional hover icon |
| `wvkbdBin -l full,special --landscape-layers full,special` | `wvkbd-mobintl` | wvkbd binary name or path (wvkbd backend only), can use flags too |

### Backend selection

- **`auto`** — at startup, checks if Squeekboard's D-Bus name (`sm.puri.OSK0`) is owned. Uses Squeekboard if yes, wvkbd otherwise. Detection happens once; it does not switch automatically if availability changes mid-session.
- **`squeekboard`** — always use Squeekboard.
- **`wvkbd`** — always use wvkbd.

## How it works

### Squeekboard backend

Toggle state is controlled via `gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.a11y.applications screen-keyboard-enabled`. State changes are tracked live with `dconf watch`, and Squeekboard's D-Bus presence is monitored continuously with `dbus-monitor` so the widget reacts if Squeekboard stops or starts.

#### Tablet Mode (2-in-1 Laptops)

This widget **complements** automated tablet-mode switching. 
For Niri configure `switch-events` in `~/.config/niri/config.kdl` to auto-toggle the keyboard:

```kdl
switch-events {
    tablet-mode-on { spawn "bash" "-c" "gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.a11y.applications screen-keyboard-enabled true"; }
    tablet-mode-off { spawn "bash" "-c" "gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.a11y.applications screen-keyboard-enabled false"; }
}
```

The widget will **reflect these changes in real-time** without conflicts. Manual toggles via the widget work independently of tablet-mode automation.


### wvkbd backend

The plugin takes ownership of the wvkbd process: on load it kills any pre-existing instance and relaunches it with `--hidden`. Show/hide is then controlled by sending `SIGUSR1` / `SIGUSR2` directly to the owned process. When the plugin unloads, the process is stopped.


## Known Issues

### OSK closes when opening settings from the bar (touchscreen)

When opening plugin settings from within the bar or shell interface on a touchscreen, the on-screen keyboard may close or stop receiving input. Opening settings through the general Noctalia settings panel works fine. This is a shell-level bug unrelated to this plugin.

**Workaround** until a fix lands upstream: open the following file with a text editor (requires root):

```
/etc/xdg/quickshell/noctalia-shell/Modules/MainScreen/PopupMenuWindow.qml
```

Find line 39 and change `OnDemand` to `Exclusive`:

```diff
- WlrLayershell.keyboardFocus: hasDialog ? WlrKeyboardFocus.OnDemand : WlrKeyboardFocus.None
+ WlrLayershell.keyboardFocus: hasDialog ? WlrKeyboardFocus.Exclusive : WlrKeyboardFocus.None
```

Then restart the shell.
